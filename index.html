            <p id="bio">I'm a Technical Project Manager. Originally from San Francisco, I have spent the last few years in New York learning everything I could about building smart and creative products. Throughout my career, I have managed a variety of projects for clients such as Microsoft, Hershey's, General Mills and MasterCard. I have found my sweet spot in working on a product and being a part of a fast-paced technical team. <br> <br> Also, I designed and built this site!</p>
